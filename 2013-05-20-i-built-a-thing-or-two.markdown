My first market day is coming up in a couple of weeks, and I've been thinking about how best to transport and display my drawings. I thought about those V-shaped print holders that one finds in framing shops and the like; and, being the sort who'd rather repair an old broken thing, or build my own, instead of buying a new one, I decided to give it a go.

I wanted The Thing to store and carry, as well as display. I need it to fit on a trolley with everything else, and to fit in the back of my car with everything else.

<p>The hinges I had in mind were not available at my local hardware store, so I improvised with some brackets and nuts and bolts. Not picturesque, but quite strong enough.
</p><p>
But I wasn't going to be able to hold and display a bunch of floppy pieces of calico in a safe and orderly fashion in one of these. So the idea of a simple timber frame was born. Finger-jointed pine trim; cheap, light, easy to glue and staple together, perfectly adequate. Even stops the images from rubbing together.
</p><p>

Et Voil√†! Compare with the drawing on the second piece of paper. I've added niceties like handles and clips to hold it shut.
</p><p>

It will hold 14 pieces, at a squeeze. But I didn't want to go to the trouble of putting everything on to a frame: There are plenty of drawings I care a little less about; I'd be happy to tape those (just across the top) to a piece of board, but the board would have to be 600 x 900mm to accommodate the whole piece of fabric.
</p><p>

Oh dear, what to do?
</p><p>

Could build a slightly bigger one, I suppose.
</p><p>

Unfortunately, the 600x900x3mm MDF gets a bit hefty when you put 20 or so together, so I might have to change over to coreflute for these ones. Now let's see, estate agent signs? they're usually coreflute...

If you're passing through Leura on Sunday 2nd of June between 9am and 2pm, the markets are at the Public School on the highway, just east of the tunnel. Access from the eastbound on-ramp, off the roundabout at Leura Mall.
