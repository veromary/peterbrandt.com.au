Over time Peter has collected an array of different pastels. Each has its own characteristics, the colour, texture and hardness.

After a while there are a few that stand out as very good to draw with, but others that are less appealing to work with.

Pastels are very simple tools - just pigment and chalk bound together with gum.  You can buy the pastel binder and pigment from art shops and make your own.

If you already have a whole lot of pigment in the form of ready made pastels, you can grind them up to make new ones!

A mortar and pestle is good for starters.  That helps get the sticks ground down to a gritty consistency.

To get the crushed pastels down to a powder, Peter used a metal rod on a pane of glass. It is very satisfying to see those last little rocks rolled flat into patches of coloured powder.

The powder is quite fine, so best kept in a closed container.  Don't sneeze!

The powder is mixed with the binder to a consistency not unlike tile grout.

To play it safe, Peter used a premixed Pastel Binder - a solution of gum tragacanth.  Other authorities recommend oatmeal, honey or even just distilled water.  There are lots of things to try.

Most instructions tell you to roll the paste into cylinders, but Peter was after square rods.  You can see the mould he made from Lego, with baking paper to make it easier to remove.

Next time the plan is to try extruding the paste, like using a tube of toothpaste to fill the mould.

The pastels took a day or two to dry and came out a little harder than ideal.  They also had tiny bubbles in them and some broke along the way.  Maybe rolling them helps squeeze out some of the bubbles?  Something to try next time!

All in all a good trial run.  And good to be able to mix your own colours.
