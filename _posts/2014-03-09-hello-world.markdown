Hello from the behind the scenes administrator, Veronica!  Tonight I bring you a new webpage for Peter's drawings.  After a while cogitating on how to implement my own custom gallery, I decided to go back to the convenience of Wordpress.
<!--more-->

Another feature here is some variability with pricing.  If you have ever commissioned a portrait from Peter you're likely to have received the work in record time with the instruction to pay what you think it's worth.

The art world has an enormous variability in prices charged, from millions of dollars down to a $2 mass produced oil painting from your local discount shop.  We're not trying to get fabulously wealthy here, though we do need a certain income for our family.

Hopefully I will find time to flesh out this website to rival Peter's shop at [etsy](http://avalonprand.etsy.com).  Right now I'm balancing a sleeping toddler on my lap, trying to find a comfortable position sitting cross legged typing at a footstool.  Earlier today I visited a local web design office where they have uncluttered office space with large monitors and charge $120/hour for their services.  Man, my situation couldn't be more different if I tried!

But there is an upside to working from home for a small, crazy family venture.  It's not the money.  It's having a husband working in the garage (he calls it his studio) who can come home for lunch.  It's being able to be human together, rather than stretched just getting meals and bed in time to do it all again the next day.  It's time for making recumbent tricycles from spare parts and fixing things up around the house.

Sometimes I think about getting a regular job, quitting all this volunteer work, contributing to the economy, blah, blah, blah.  But right now I am contributing, to society, to my family, to the choirs I help out with, to parents who phone the helplines I volunteer for.  It is worthwhile.
