We had a conversation one night, about ideas for drawings.

Peter often draws celebrities, which you might think would be popular.  But it takes all sorts, and celebrities are apt to do crazy things and their reputation rubs off on the picture to some extent.  Public regard for a particular celebrity may wax and wane erratically.

How about drawing something really niche.  Something that Peter is really passionate about. Like, spark plugs.

See, Peter and I have four boys and they love cars, model cars, watching Top Gear, and all that sort of stuff.  They know about all those odd parts that make up machines.

So first came the spark plug, then gears, brakes and things like that.  The actual drawings are [available here.](http://peterbrandt.com.au/product-category/picturesque-parts/)  Prints, cards and posters (and the odd sticker and t-shirt) are available [through redbubble](http://www.redbubble.com/people/swissbrandt/collections/272126-picturesque-parts).
