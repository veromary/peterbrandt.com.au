They recently moved to St Marys and have a shop set up in an old school room, part of the new Mackillop Centre for Our Lady of the Rosary Parish.

Our kids enjoy having a look around when they are at the centre for a homeschool co-op. As well as the new things you might expect - books, beads, Bibles - they also have a bargain box of old stock.  Some of the kids found very cute angel brooches for less than $1.

The ladies in the shop offered some wall space for Peter's drawings. The Catholic Church has a whole gallery of heroes to study, with two new saints being recognised this year after Easter, Karol Wojtyla and Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, better know as Pope John Paul II and Pope John XXIII.

The process includes examining their lives for holiness or otherwise.  That's where we get the term Devil's Advocate - an unofficial term for the one to prepare the case against sainthood.

They also require authenticated miracles, perhaps the most controversial part of the whole process.  Pope John XXIII is credited with [curing a dying nun of tuberculosis](http://www.saintanthonyofpadua.net/messaggero/pagina_stampa.asp?R=&ID=80).  Pope John Paul II has been credited with so many miracles, but the two chosen were [the healing of a nun from Parkinson's](http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/sister-marie-simon-pierre-on-her-cure-from-parkinson) and [a Costa Rican woman from a brain aneurysm](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-story-behind-the-miracle-leading-to-pope-john-paul-ii-canonization-a-956912.html).

The two portraits are drawn playing with colours, a subtle palette for the faces, picking out a colorful accent for contrast, John Paul's gold Ring of the Fisherman, Pope John's red mozetta.

Peter usually draws on a canvas about 50x75cm, but for these ones he went a bit smaller, being a little easier to accomodate at about A3 size.  They will be available from the [Cardinal Newman Shop](http://cardinalnewman.com.au/) soon.
