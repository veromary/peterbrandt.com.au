Maybe Springwood's greatest achievement is not its balance between Blue Mountains beauty and easy access from Sydney, or the new civic centre under construction, but the fact that it is home to not one, but three bookshops -

[Turning Page](http://www.theturningpagebookshop.com.au/), [Brown Books](http://www.brownbooks.com.au/) and [JimmyD's](http://jimmyds.com.au/). We have found wonderful treasures in each one of them, but JimmyD's is particularly special as they have three of Peter's drawings hanging there.

JimmyD's Bookshop is a treasure trove of second hand books, coffee cups, ecosilk bags, cards and lots of amazing things (teapots in the shape of African animals anybody?). The quotes on the chalkboard out the front gives a daily lift to passers by.

The three drawings available at JimmyD's are a bit of a mixed bunch. 

The anonymous fangirl is drawn with a light touch for fan and her hair, framing her lively eyes.

Marilyn uses some crazy impressionist style colouring giving the work a more lively feel.  Her cool expression contrasts with her turbulent background.

![Superman]({{ site.url }}/images/superman-199x300.jpg){: .floatright}
Christopher Reeve has bolder colours for his superman uniform, while his gaze upwards suggests super-hero style dedication and courage, or maybe a touch of "argh!"

You can find Jimmy D's towards the station end of the shops on Macquarie Rd.  Nearby shops include the St Vincent de Paul Op Shop and the RSPCA shop, but you will find your own favourites in Springwood.
