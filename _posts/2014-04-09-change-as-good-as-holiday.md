You might notice something a little different about the web page today.  The new design is a whole lot simpler.  The "products" are gone. Hopefully this will show that we are less about being a shop and more about, well, about *drawing*.

Peter has been drawing celebrities because:

 1. They look good - the photos are well lit, composed, etc.
 2. People know them - so they can judge the likeness
 3. People like them - so they sell

There is a problem though, that drawing from photos requires permission if the image is not substantially changed.  Peter has maintained that going from photo to canvas is a substantial change, but not everyone sees it like that.

So, the plan is to keep drawing, but not label or tag the drawings on redbubble.

Ideally, it would be great to have a whole lot of requests for drawings with clear terms about what can be done with the images.  To that end we have a new [Contact Form]({{ site.url }}/contact) where you can send a photo and specify what Peter can do with it.

We still have a whole bunch of drawings ready to go. [The Etsy shop](http://avalonprand.etsy.com) is still ticking away, but looking at other options, there is a new Sydney based web service calles Selz which is very nifty.  There is a whole lot more work to do, but bit by bit we will keep building.
