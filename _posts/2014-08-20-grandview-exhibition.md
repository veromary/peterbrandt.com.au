The Grandview Hotel is prominent on the Great Western Highway on the south side, just east of the main shopping area.  It is an easy walk from the train station.  

[Wentworth Falls](http://www.bluemts.com.au/info/towns/wentworth-falls/) is famous for its spectacular waterfalls on the south side.  Locals might prefer the manmade lake on the north side - made to provide water for steam engines when the rail line came through last century.  The lake has two playgrounds and new footpaths and covered bbq area.

There are 14 artworks on display from members of the [Blue Mountains Artist Network](http://www.bman.org.au).

The [Blue Mountains Artist Network](http://www.bman.org.au) runs exhibitions at the Grandview four times each year.

The cat portrait, titled *I can read your mind*, is drawn from a photo in pastel on calico in Peter's usual size of 50x75cm. An engaging character for any cat-lover, particularly seal-point Balinese or Long Haired Siamese cats. Or Himalayan Persian Cats.

*I can read your mind* is available for $185.

![Les escaliers de montmatre]({{ site.url }}/images/escaliers.jpg){:.floatleft}This picture is from a famous black and white photo of the stairs to Montmatre in Paris by Brassai in 1936.

Montmatre is renowned as a haven for artists, notably Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali and Vincent Van Gogh.  Crowning the hill is the white-domed Basilica of the Sacré Cœur.

Peter's picture adds some subtle colour to the scene.

*Les escaliers de Montmatre* is also available for $185 at [the Grandview](http://www.thegrandviewhotel.com/).

Monday and Tuesday nights have a two for one meal deal at the Bistro. The Hotel recommends you book ahead.
