#Avalon Prand 

###Peter Brandt

The value in his work is more as an exercise; to him, the finished piece is incidental. 

Peter's daily discipline produces prolific portraiture. Vindicated by an online appetite for consistent sources of content, people all over the world volunteering their faces for his habit. And a drawing archive of thousands to match. But even a cultivated habit requires courage to break. The struggle between being too conservative with colour, but hating to waste a drawing by being too crazy. This is his careful tightrope act to extract that elusive, effective technique.

The mermaid isn't mine.  It is one side of Mark Ogge's mechanical, musical diorama.
