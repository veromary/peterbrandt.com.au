###Who is Peter Brandt?

![Peter with Elizabeth mid 2014]({{ site.url }}/images/peter1.jpg){:.floatright}
Born in Mona Vale, I have lived on Sydney's northern beaches, inner west, south in Wollongong, north near Brisbane and now live with my family in the Blue Mountains.  The photo shows me with wife, four boys, little girl and two guinea pigs (the cat wisely kept out of the way).

The name **Avalon Prand** was coined to be a unique name for signing up for tumblr.  Avalon in Sydney is where I grew up.  Prand is my Estonian grandfather's surname, that he later germanicised into Brandt.
	
I have always enjoyed drawing, whether in pencil, ink or pastel. For a while I focussed on making bold black and white ink studies and lino cuts.

My favourite artists include Alfonse Mucha.

I like listening to David Bowie, Yello, Yasuaki Shimizu, They Might Be Giants and many others.  Bach is great too.

My wife Veronica does the webpage side of things.
