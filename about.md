###Who is Peter Brandt?

Born in Mona Vale, I have lived on Sydney's northern beaches, inner west, south in Wollongong, north near Brisbane and now live with my family in the Blue Mountains.  I draw people, pets, automobiles, architecture from photos.

The name **Avalon Prand** was coined to be a unique name for signing up for tumblr.  Avalon in Sydney is where I grew up.  Prand is my Estonian grandfather's surname, that he later germanicised into Brandt.
	
For those who draw, no explanation is necessary.
For those who do not draw, no explanation is possible.

I know that is a complete cop out.

What would you like to know?

Peter has always been drawing in one way or another.  He finds working on a picture satisfying.  

He grew up on Sydney's northern beaches, back before they became a mecca for fans of Baywatch.

He likes awful music, 80s electronic experimental weird stuff.

His wife is possibly worse at writing this sort of bumpf than he is.

I will remember to change this before making the page live!
