###Who is Peter Brandt?

For those who draw, no explanation is necessary.
For those who do not draw, no explanation is possible.

I know that is a complete cop out.

What would you like to know?

Peter has always been drawing in one way or another.  He finds working on a picture satisfying.  

He grew up on Sydney's northern beaches, back before they became a mecca for fans of Baywatch.

He likes awful music, 80s electronic experimental weird stuff.

His wife is possibly worse at writing this sort of bumpf than he is.

I will remember to change this before making the page live!
