<h3>Portraits I prepared earlier</h3>
<p>
I keep drawing for fun and to fine tune my fingers.  This fills up the shelves in my studio with stacks of artworks in need of new homes.
</p>
<p>
The majority of drawings you see in my <a href="http://avalonprand.com">tumblr</a> portfolio are available for sale.  Postage is $10 in Australia, $30 elsewhere.  <a href="mailto:peterjabrandt@gmail.com?subject=I want to buy a drawing&body=Hi Peter, please send me your drawings.">Make an offer!</a>
</p>
<p>
For the online shopping experience I have an <b><a href="http://avalonprand.etsy.com">Etsy Shop</a></b>.
</p>
<p>For the really adventurous, my wife has been working on cataloging all my drawings.  You can see the results at <a href="http://work.peterbrandt.com.au">work.peterbrandt.com.au</a>.  You can see there are lots of drawings in stock.  Make an offer.</p>
